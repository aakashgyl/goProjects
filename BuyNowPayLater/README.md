# Buy Now Pay Later Service
As a pay later service we allow our users to buy goods from a merchant now, and then allow them to pay for those goods at a later date.
The service works inside the boundary of following simple constraints -
1. Let's say that for every transaction paid through us, we deduct some transaction fees
while paying back to the merchant..
   - For example, if the transaction amount is Rs.100, and the transaction fee is 10%,
   we pay Rs. 90 back to the merchant.
   - The fee varies from merchant to merchant.
   - A merchant can decide to change the fee, at any point in time.
2. All users get onboarded with a credit limit, beyond which they can't transact.
   - If a transaction value crosses this credit limit, we reject the transaction.
   
##Use Cases
There are various use cases our service is intended to fulfil
- allow merchants to be onboarded with the fee
- allow merchants fee to be changed
- allow users to be onboarded (name, email-id and credit-limit)
- allow a user to carry out a transaction of some amount with a merchant.
- allow a user to pay back their dues (full or partial)
- for inputs like merchant fee percentage changes or credit limit changes for a user, the
  system adapts itself.
- Reporting:
  - how much fee weâ€™ve collected from a merchant till date
  - dues for a user so far
  - which users have reached their credit limit
  - total dues from all users together
